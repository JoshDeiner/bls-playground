describe why are you committing to testing


i think testing has the ability to create a documentation of kinds that is different to recognize.

it shows what is important for application. if you don't test it is it important or stable? (probably not core)

it gives me the ability to onboard quickly.

also provides me a case to say do you really understand can you stay on this concept or part of this application until you truly know what it is doing.

there is this want to rush through features. holding onto testing says hey we want to move but at the cost of future speed. 
(on a related note i dont want to have to guess what will go wrong in the future)

people will argue testing is expensive, well i would say this is something to work around
